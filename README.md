# Programming Concepts
### HelloWorld:
My journey in Java programming began with this foundational project. The "HelloWorld" program is a simple yet essential introduction to Java, allowing me to grasp the basics of syntax, structure, and the development environment.

### Consecutive Equal Numbers:
This project involves a program that checks for the presence of four consecutive numbers of the same value within a two-dimensional list. It demonstrates my ability to work with complex data structures and implement algorithms to solve specific problems.

### Investment Value Calculator:
A financial tool that calculates the future value of an investment based on a given interest rate and a specified number of years. This project helped me understand the practical application of mathematical formulas in programming and financial analysis.

## Upcoming Projects
* Loan Calculator:
A comprehensive program designed to compute the repayment schedule for a loan, including interest calculations, payment breakdowns, and amortization tables. This project will enhance my understanding of financial algorithms and user interface design.

* Tax Calculator:
This project will focus on creating a tool to calculate taxes based on current tax laws and individual financial data. It will involve implementing complex logic to handle various tax scenarios and ensuring accuracy and compliance with regulations.
